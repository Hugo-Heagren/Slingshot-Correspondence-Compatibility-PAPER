IS TRUTH A RELATION BETWEEN WHAT IS SAID OR THOUGHT AND HOW THE WORLD IS? PLAN

Intro
	This essay defends the facts-based correspondence theory (as a sgenreal schem(e/a) against the 'slingshot' form / family of arguments. 
	Specifically: the slingshot argument argues that if facts based correspondence teory is true, then all truthbearers are made true (???) by the same truthmaker, and that this contradicts the original motivations for the correspondence theory.
	First I introduce and explain the correspondence theory as a schem(e/a) and the slingshot as a form of argument against it.
		Mention some motivations for the slingshot, and variuos instnaces of it's use for different puroses (Davidson, and at least on enon-scorrespondence theorist etc.)
	Then explain  how in fact the conclusion of the slingshot accords with our intuitions about truth (especially those which originally motivated the correspondence theory)
	(if I have space I could talk here about various possible objections)
