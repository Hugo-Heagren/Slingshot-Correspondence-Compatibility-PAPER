This essay defends facts-based and similarly structured correspondence theories from Davidson's `Great Fact' and other slingshot arguments (an argument schema of which Davidson's argument is an example).
I will introduce the correspondence theory as a schem(e/a) and the slingshot as a form of argument, then mention how the slinghot is applied to the correspondence theory.
I argue that the slingshot argument is compatible with the correspondence theory, that it's conclusion about the nature of truth, and the further premise needed to develop an objection from it is unjustified.
