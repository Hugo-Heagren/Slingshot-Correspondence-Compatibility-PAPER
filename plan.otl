IS TRUTH A RELATION BETWEEN WHAT IS SAID OR THOUGHT AND HOW THE WORLD IS? PLAN

Ideas:
	Something about whether Logical Subatomsim can't account for non-truth-functional connectives
	Something about whether or not the correspondence theory needs to posit factrs wheree there aren't any (aesthetics etc.)
	A defense of the corespondence theory of truth against the charge that it leads to skepticism (and shouldn't)
	Defense against the Big Fact argument (see below)
